# MTF Confluence Reporter — 4MA Table x StochRSI Table

A multi-timeframe confluence dashboard that combines trend direction (4MA) and momentum (StochRSI) into a single confluence read with a 0–100 strength score.

This tool helps answer:
“Is the market aligned across timeframes — and how strong is that alignment?”

## Components

**4MA Table**
Represents trend direction across selected timeframes.

**Stoch Table**
Represents momentum alignment across selected timeframes.

**Qualified**

**Confluence**

**Hysteresis**

## How I Use This Indicator

I use this as a **market context and risk-filter tool**, not an entry signal.

- Bull confluence → favor long setups
- Bear confluence → defensive posture
- Qualified = NO → reduce risk

Strength helps determine **how aggressive or patient** to be.
